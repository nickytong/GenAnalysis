# GenAnalysis

This is the R package I developed while working at the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center. 

Major functions include:
- data type-aware visualizations (continuous vs continuous, continuous vs categorical, categorical vs categorical with the same interface as plotScatter)
- streamlined analysis pipeline (hypothesis testing between rows of a matrix and target variable, adjustment of multiple testing using false discovery rate, and visualizations), 
- simplified yet flexible heatmap generation
- and various utility functions for data cleaning and blending

Now the package is internally used in the department for high throughput genomic data analysis.
